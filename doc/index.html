      <div id="content"><div id='filecontents'><h1>Intro</h1>

<p>This Manager Tools Logging tool is designed for tech-savvy line managers who
spend a lot of time on the command line and would like an easy way to record
notes from Manager Tools practices. Today, the tool supports one-on-ones and
feedback.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>The tool requires Ruby 2.0+ and the Asciidoctor and Bundler gems, among others.</p>

<h2>The &#39;mt&#39; script</h2>

<p>I created an omnibus script to call the various functions from one script. Over
time, it replaced some standalone scripts.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ bundle install # ... installs all the gems required

$ ./mt new-hire -t avengers -n &quot;Tony Stark&quot;
Creating data/avengers/tony-stark

Reviewing data/avengers/tony-stark/overview.adoc... generating

$ ./mt o3 tony
For your 1:1 with Tony Stark, enter the following:
Location: |none| Avengers Tower
Notes: |none| Tony told me about the altercation with Steve today. I
suggested a less confrontation approach.
Actions: |none| See if HR offers anger management classes.

$ ./mt o3 steve
Team: Avengers
First: Steve
Last: Rogers
Creating data/avengers/steve-rogers
For your 1:1 with Steve Rogers, enter the following:
Location: |none| Avengers Tower
Notes: |none| Steve was upset by Tony trying to provoke him in the team room.
Actions: |none|
</code></pre>

<p>Notice a couple of things here. I used the <code>new-hire</code> script to create some
infrastructure for Tony. However, when I didn&#39;t do that with Steve, the script
prompted me for the data it needed. Here are the files that were created:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ tree data
data
└── avengers
    ├── steve-rogers
    │   └── log.adoc
    └── tony-stark
        ├── log.adoc
        └── overview.adoc
</code></pre>

<p>These scripts store their data as Asciidoc files. Notice that Tony has an
overview file, which was created by the new hire script.</p>

<p>You can also provide <code>feedback</code>:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ ./mt feedback tony
With feedback for Tony Stark, enter the following:
Polarity: |positive| negative
Content: |none| When you try to provoke people in the team room, it makes
bystanders uncomfortable. Can you do that differently next time?
</code></pre>

<p>You can make observations about direct reports. Observations are an entry type
for adding content to a log which does not come from an interaction with the
direct report.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ ./mt observation steve
Enter your observation for Steve Rogers:
Content: |none| My manager came to me after seeing Steve getting some basic
computer help. She asked if computer training was part of his annual goal
plan.
</code></pre>

<p>Other entry options not covered here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <code>interview</code> (which uses a team called <code>zzz_candidates</code>)</li>
<li>  <code>team meeting</code>, which propagates the content to the logs of all members of
the team</li>
</ul>

<p>After our examples, this is what data/avengers/tony-stark/log.adoc contains:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">== One-on-One (July 29, 2015,  2:49 PM)
Location::
  Avengers Tower
Notes::
  Tony told me about the altercation with Steve today. I suggested a less
  confrontation approach.
Actions::
  See if HR offers anger management classes.

== Feedback (July 29, 2015,  3:02 PM)
Polarity::
  negative
Content::
  When you try to provoke people in the team room, it makes bystanders
  uncomfortable. Can you do that differently next time?
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the script did some word-wrapping for you.</p>

<p>I can generate missing team files using <code>gen-overview-files</code>.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ ./mt gen-overview-files
Generating avengers Steve Rogers...
Generating avengers Tony Stark...
</code></pre>

<p>I manually created a team-directory.adoc file:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">= Team Directory

== Team Avengers

include::data/avengers/steve-rogers/overview.adoc[]

include::data/avengers/tony-stark/overview.adoc[]
</code></pre>

<p>And was able to generate a nice-looking HTML file by running Asciidoctor against
it:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ asciidoctor team-directory.adoc
$ ls team-directory.html
team-directory.html
</code></pre>

<p>If you want a report on a particular team member, use the <code>report</code> script, which
combines the overview and log files into a nice HTML file. The overview template
assumes that there is a file called &quot;headshot.jpg&quot; in each person&#39;s folder, and
displays it at the top right corner of the file.</p>

<p>Of course, who would want to do that manually? There&#39;s also a Rakefile that
contains some of these commands. (If you followed along and now try to run
<code>rake</code>, you&#39;ll have problems because the test data uses the Avengers too. The
test suite assumes that it can create and destroy Avengers data at will.)</p>

<h2>Lookups</h2>

<p>The script finds people by looking at a string containing the team name and the
individual&#39;s name, then finding the first match in alphabetical order. This is
the reason that the candidates folder is prefaced with &quot;zzz_&quot;, in order to make
it last in the search order.</p>

<p>This algorithm can be problematic in some edge cases. For example, I have a
&quot;Tommy&quot; team, and that person has a person named Tom on it. If I just reference
&quot;tom&quot;, I get Andy, the person on the Tommy team who comes first in alphabetical
order. In order to reference Tom, I have to say, &quot;tom-&quot;. So far, this has not
been enough of an issue for me to correct.</p>

<p>Another issue I&#39;ve discovered is that the lookup logic fails if there is a dash
in the team name. Again, this has not been a high enough priority for me to
fix.</p>

<h1>Extensibility</h1>

<h2>Changing where data is stored</h2>

<p>In <code>lib/employee_folder.rb</code>, there is a variable called <code>root</code> which defines
where your data is stored. The variable <code>candidates_root</code> determines in which
folder interviews are recorded.</p>

<p>I manually move the folders of people who no longer report to me to a team
folder called &quot;zzz_departed&quot;. The script will still find them as normal. You can
also use the same approach when people change teams. It happens infrequently
enough for me that I didn&#39;t automate it.</p>

<h2>Adding a new entry type</h2>

<p>If you want to add a new diary entry type, you will need to create a new entry
class in <code>lib</code>, using the naming convention <code>type + Entry</code>, for example
ObservationEntry for an observation.</p>

<p>After creating a new entry type according to the subsection, you need to update
the main <code>mt</code> script to parse your new entry type. Use the existing types as a
guide. For simple cases, &quot;invoke module directly&quot; is the right option.</p>

<h3>Creating the new entry type</h3>

<p>Looking at ObservationEntry as an example, you will see there are three methods
to customize:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>class</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="ObservationEntry.html" title="ObservationEntry (class)">ObservationEntry</a></span></span> <span class='op'>&lt;</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="DiaryEntry.html" title="DiaryEntry (class)">DiaryEntry</a></span></span>
  <span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='kw'>self</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_prompt'>prompt</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_name'>name</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
    <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>Enter your observation for </span><span class='embexpr_beg'>#{</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_name'>name</span><span class='embexpr_end'>}</span><span class='tstring_content'>:</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span>
  <span class='kw'>end</span>

  <span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='kw'>self</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_elements_array'>elements_array</span>
    <span class='lbracket'>[</span>
      <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="DiaryElement.html" title="DiaryElement (class)">DiaryElement</a></span></span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_new'><span class='object_link'><a href="DiaryElement.html#initialize-instance_method" title="DiaryElement#initialize (method)">new</a></span></span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='symbol'>:location</span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>Location</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>unspecified</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='rparen'>)</span><span class='comma'>,</span>
      <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="DiaryElement.html" title="DiaryElement (class)">DiaryElement</a></span></span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_new'><span class='object_link'><a href="DiaryElement.html#initialize-instance_method" title="DiaryElement#initialize (method)">new</a></span></span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='symbol'>:content</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
    <span class='rbracket'>]</span>
  <span class='kw'>end</span>

  <span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_to_s'>to_s</span>
    <span class='id identifier rubyid_render'>render</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>Observation</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
  <span class='kw'>end</span>
<span class='kw'>end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>prompt</code> text is displayed at the beginning of the recording.</p>

<p>Each element in the <code>elements_array</code> becomes a question that is asked of the
user. This example shows two entries. In the <code>location</code> entry, the prompt is
specified in the second argument, and the default value is the third. The
<code>content</code> entry shows that the last two arguments are optional.</p>

<p>The <code>to_s</code> method is what gets written to the log file, and in most cases should
be the results of the <code>render</code> method. The argument to <code>render</code> is the entry
header.</p>

<h1>Usage Hints</h1>

<p>In cases where I want to quote material, I will often use the script to fill in
values. I then use a text editor like Atom to add the quoted material, like a
chat room transcript or email.</p>
